# Project Documentation for Lillian Jensen

## Project Summary
For this project, my contribution was the content of the entire body, including the grid that contains all the example products that were listed and the three information boxes at the bottom of the page. I was also in charge of assigning people their roles of the project and making sure everything was done correctly.
