# Project Documentation for Maya

## Project Summery (2 paragraphs)
lorem: Some information about the taem project and my contributions.

 For this project we were assigned to create a website we were given from our instructor. Our website is based off wellness treatments, gym equipment and healthprograms. Some of the items we provide are vitamins, weightloss, yoga mats, weight gain, and articles of good physical fitness. The way we implied this was to create a healthy site for helping others to live a better, active and healtheir lifrstyle. Our website is called "Elevate". The products we have provided for this website are afforable, high quality, and for audience wanting to be more proactive. Elevate is a company for top wellness services, along with top popular trends which includes workout equipment/material aswell as all natural ingredients in every healthy supplements we carry.

 The way I collaborated with this project was assisting with anyone that needed it. I helped work on the footer, giving advice to make it look a bit more presentable, little less plain. I made the footer look more symmetrical and lined up as evenly as possible. I worked on the slides, adding information, while also making them seem fit to be seen. After the presentation with our instructor, Jensen and I worked more on the slides working with the feedback we were given.

This div was created for the button/ the bubble you clic in the footer. The bubble was made for adding your email. 
<div>
          <label id="check" class="radio-inline" style="float:right">I agree to the Privacy Policy<br>and Terms of
            Conditions.</label><input type="radio" name="options" id="agree"></input>
        </div>

.some class {}

This was made to position the button/ bubble to be symmetrical. including the text that goes with the button/ bubble.
```css
input#agree {
      display: inline-block;
      margin-right: -80px;
      margin-top: 20px;
      position: absolute;
      margin-left: 4px;
      border: none;
    }

    label#check {
      font-size: 15px;
      display: inline-block;
      padding: 10px;
      margin-left: 19px;
      position: absolute;
      text-align: center;

    }
